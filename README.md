*** PROJECT SUSPENDED ****
Because Peter sucks at coding, he has decided to stop wasting his
time pretending that he can do anything that isn't extremely basic
that a toddler can do and abandon this project until he feels like 
he might be able to do something which at his current rate of learning
may be sometime in the next few decades. Let's all wish him luck!

# Metronome
A tool used by musicians to keep time!

The plan is simple, but the execution will no doubt not be simple.

The idea is to have a metronome created using Javascript hosted on a 
webpage with HTML and CSS. Planned functionality includes:

- Audio playback in quarter notes based on a given tempo
- User-adjustable tempo
- Animation

*OPTIONAL/PLANNED FEATURES*
- Ability to turn off certain beats
- Support for multiple claves
- Support for multiple note durations
- Light/Dark mode
- Support for multiple Time Signatures
- Support for user to input specific BPM

*Initial Thoughts*

For the basic functionality I am thinking of utilizing a while loop.
While the loop is running, code running at a time interval controlled by
a variable representing the bpm will play audio (the click). While loop
can be controlled by a button. I could also use this to have some kind of 
timed animation that represents the current bpm.
