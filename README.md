# Metronome
A tool used by musicians to keep time!

The plan is simple, but the execution will no doubt not be simple.

The idea is to have a metronome created using Javascript hosted on a 
webpage with HTML and CSS. Planned functionality includes:

- Audio playback in quarter notes based on a given tempo
- User-adjustable tempo
- Animation

*OPTIONAL/PLANNED FEATURES*
- Ability to turn off certain beats
- Support for multiple claves
- Support for multiple note durations
- Light/Dark mode
- Support for multiple Time Signatures
